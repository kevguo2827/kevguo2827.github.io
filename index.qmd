# About me 

My name is Dingyu Guo, and I am a first-year M.S. student in Statistics at the University of Chicago. I graduated from Boston University in 2024 with a passion for Sports Analytics and Statistics. I am excited to merge my technical skills and enthusiasm for sports to uncover new insights and contribute to the field of analytics.
