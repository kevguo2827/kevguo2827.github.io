This is a personal website I am making for \[STAT 37815: Practical R Programming
with Extensions\](https://stat.uchicago.edu/academics/course-info/2024-2025-cour
ses/autumn-2024-stat-37815-1/) with \[Dr. McShane\](https://ryanmcshane.com).

The website is designed to showcase my work and projects in R programming, as well as other personal and academic endeavors. I plan to update it periodically as I complete new projects and learn additional skills. This platform will serve as a portfolio to highlight my growth in programming and statistical analysis.
